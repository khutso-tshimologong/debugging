This repository contains code from a variety of different projects that have been worked on,  These projects are written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Thanks to Renzo for his 'To-do List' project.
Thanks to Phiwa for his 'Weather' project.

This code must be forked to your own repository, and then fixed.

Here is a specification of what the code should look like:
1.  Go to Google Drive:
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rVSYzQ0zdE9Lot6agsrGEPUxLUtKagC6?usp=sharing

    You will find the prototype for this project.  
    The prototype should be opened using Adobe XD.
    For this project, the prototype is a supplied as a guide, we do not expect your website to look exactly like the prototype.
    We want you to be creative, but stick to the general colours and types.

2.  Get the website up and running by debugging and fixing the bugs.

GOOD LUCK!
